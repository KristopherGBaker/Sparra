/**
 * `conductors/core` — the host-agnostic core for building a Sparra **conductor** (the interactive
 * host that drives the collaborative loop: contract → generate → cross-model evaluate → decide).
 *
 * It provides the pieces that are the SAME regardless of which host conducts (Pi, opencode, a plain
 * program):
 *   - {@link ./summary.ts}  — the holdout wall in code: `toParentSummary` + the type-checked
 *                             allowlist. A conductor exposes only a `ParentSummary` to its context.
 *   - {@link ./roleClient.ts} — `runRole` / `runRoleRaw`: run one role via `sparra … --json` and
 *                             get back the redacted summary.
 *   - {@link ./roleWorker.ts} — a spawnable process boundary for model-driven hosts.
 *   - {@link ./pool.ts}     — `runRolesConcurrently`: bounded-concurrent isolated role-runs, since
 *                             not every host offers them natively.
 *
 * The canonical envelope itself lives in `src/roleEnvelope.ts` (the runner↔conductor contract);
 * these types re-export it so a host imports one place.

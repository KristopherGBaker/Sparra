# Configuration

Every knob lives in **`.sparra/config.yaml`** (seeded on `init` with mode-aware defaults; edit and re-run any phase — changes are picked up live). Models accept SDK aliases (`opus` · `sonnet` · `haiku` · `fable`) or full model ids. Anything you omit inherits the default.

```yaml

## Notes on a few knobs
- **`roles.*.backend`** — `claude` (default) or `codex`. See [backends](backends.md). Decomposition reads best on Claude; keep `decomposer` there if you put the builder on Codex.
- **`roles.*.baseUrl` / `roles.*.apiKey`** — point a role at an OpenAI-compatible endpoint instead of the backend default — e.g. a **local** model served by LM Studio (`http://localhost:1234/v1`) or Ollama. Only the **`codex`** backend honors it (Codex supplies the agent loop + tools; the model runs locally). `model` is then the local model id; `apiKey` defaults to a dummy. See [backends — local models](backends.md#local-models-lm-studio--ollama).
- **`roles.*.sandbox`** — `workspace-write` (default) | `danger-full-access`, for a **write** role on the **`codex`** backend (Claude has no OS sandbox and ignores it). `workspace-write` scopes writes to the work tree with no network; `danger-full-access` lifts the sandbox so a Codex generator can run native toolchains the default Seatbelt profile blocks — e.g. `xcodebuild`. **Read-only roles ignore this — they are always `read-only`.** **Safety:** `danger-full-access` is honored **only when the build runs on a git worktree/branch** (`git.strategy: worktree`/`branch`); on an in-place / greenfield-no-git run it is downgraded to `workspace-write` with a loud warning (the worktree is the only safety boundary, since Codex runs with no interception hooks). See [backends — per-role sandbox](backends.md#per-role-sandbox-codex--the-worktree-safety-gate).
- **`roles.generatorLocal`** — an optional **second generator** for **hybrid builds**. Work items the decomposer tags `gen: "local"` (trivially-simple or privacy-sensitive) build on `generatorLocal`; everything else uses `generator`. Unset → all items use `generator`. You can add/remove the `gen` tag per item in `.sparra/workitems/items.json` before building (the decomposer only proposes it, and only when `generatorLocal` is configured).
- **`permission.mode`** — `auto` uses the SDK's model-classifier approvals when available on your plan, else `acceptEdits`; either way a deny-hook (Claude) / sandbox (Codex) enforces scope. `bypassPermissions` is refused.
- **`contract`** — the assertion range is an *upper guide*, scaled down for small items; the evaluator rejects padding and over-specification. See [build loop](build-loop.md).
- **`build` budgets** — start-closed; crossing the USD **or** token cap halts an item as `BUDGET_EXCEEDED` and the run continues. `total_cost_usd` is notional on a subscription — use `maxTokensPerItem` there.
- **`build.autoRestart`** — the "heartbeat" for **unattended** builds: when the generator or evaluator hits a real **provider** rate/usage/session limit (vs. your own budget caps), the loop either switches to a configured **`fallback`** model or **waits** for the window to reopen, then retries the **same** round — instead of burning it. Off by default (opting in lets a build sleep for hours). State is checkpointed before each wait, so a kill mid-wait still resumes from disk; `sparra status` shows a paused build as *waiting until …*. After `maxRestarts` wait cycles it stops cleanly — re-run `sparra build` to resume. See [build loop](build-loop.md#auto-restart--model-fallback-on-provider-limits).
- **`roles.*.fallback`** — a backup `RoleConfig` (model/backend/effort/…) used when the primary role's **backend** is in a limit window (requires `build.autoRestart.enabled`). Best pointed at a **different provider** (e.g. primary `gpt-5-codex` on Codex → fallback `opus` on Claude): on a limit the loop switches models and keeps going with **no wait**, switching back once the primary's window reopens. Chainable (a fallback may have its own `fallback`); a fallback on the same, also-limited backend is skipped. Limits are keyed by backend because a plan window (e.g. Claude's 5-hour) is account-wide across that provider's models.
- **`exercise.ios`** — full Apple-platform guide in [docs/ios.md](ios.md).
- **`review`** — an optional agent code-review gate after the behavioral evaluator passes (a second lens for code quality the exerciser can't see). Off by default; see [build loop](build-loop.md#code-review-optional). Best with `roles.reviewer.backend` set to a *different* family than the generator.
- **`build.skills` / `roles.*.skills`** — agent skills (SKILL.md) made available to a role. Builder roles (`generator`, `prototyper`) inherit `build.skills`; other roles (e.g. `evaluator`) opt in via their own `roles.<role>.skills`. Resolved from the repo's `skills/`, `~/.claude/skills`, or `~/.agents/skills` (or an explicit path). See [backends — skills](backends.md#skills). Example: `roles.evaluator.skills: ["xcodebuildmcp-cli"]` to give the iOS grader your build/run skill.
- **`docsDir`** — subfolder (relative to the repo root) for the human-facing docs Sparra manages — `PLAN.md`, `CODEBASE_MAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `HOLDOUT.md`. `""` (default) keeps them at the root; e.g. `docs` puts them under `docs/` to keep the root uncluttered. Set it at `sparra init --docs <dir>` (it's baked into `config.yaml`); `.sparra/` machinery stays put regardless.
- **`build.extraReadDirs`** — extra directories the build (generator **and** evaluator) may **read**, beyond the work dir and repo root — added to each backend's `additionalDirectories`. For large assets you don't want in git: pre-stage them once (e.g. a face-recognition model under `~/.cache/…`) and list the dir here, so the sandboxed build reads it **without committing it or opening network**. Paths may be absolute, `~`-prefixed, or relative to the repo root. (Codex grants read+write to these within its sandbox; Claude grants read with writes still gated — treat as read-only intent.)

## On-disk artifacts
The filesystem is the source of truth and the only shared state — inspectable, diffable, resumable.

The human-facing docs sit at the project root by default; set **`docsDir`** (or
`sparra init --docs <dir>`) to tuck them into a subfolder like `docs/` and keep the
root clean. `.sparra/` machinery is unaffected.

`memory.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CODEBASE_MAP.md`, `config.yaml`, `calibration/`, and `prompts/`
persist across cycles; the rest of the working set is archived per cycle by `sparra new`.

## Resuming
`sparra resume` continues whatever phase you're in, purely from `.sparra/state.json` + the artifacts. Re-run `sparra build` to resume an interrupted build — passed items are skipped; `BUDGET_EXCEEDED`/`abandoned` items are skipped too.
